Image / Meta
============
`Salvador Dali <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Dal%C3%AD>`_, a Spanish surealist artist, is infamous for allegedly forging his own work. In his latter years, it's said that he signed blank canvases and tens of thousands of sheets of lithographic paper (under duress of his guardians). In the image atop this ``README``, he's seen with his pet ocelot, Babou.

Respectfully speaking, Salvador Dali and his pet ocelot are awesome, and no disgrace is intended by using his picture.
