Image / Meta
============
`Salvador Dali <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Dal%C3%AD>`_, a Spanish surealist artist, is infamous for allegedly forging his own work. In his latter years, it's said that he signed blank canvases and tens of thousands of sheets of lithographic paper (under duress of his guardians). In the image atop this ``README``, he's seen with his pet ocelot, Babou.

Practically speaking, Salvador Dali and Babou are pretty awesome, and I intend to throw no shade at him or his legacy.

This image is recomposed from the original, whose metadata is below.
